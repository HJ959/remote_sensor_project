Remote Pi data grabber for woodlands

A raspberry pi / Arduino combo that gathers moisture, temperature, images and audio data before pushing to GitHub repo for use in a front-end site that displays the data. An old Christmas biscuit tin with a battery bank for power and a small microphone and webcam for gathering the audio and visual data plus a small moisture/temperature sensor circuit. Left remotely gathering harmless woodland data for visualisation.
